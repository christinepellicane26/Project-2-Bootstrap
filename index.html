<h1><center>The Wonderful World of <br>Cluster Ballooning</center></h1>
<p>All you think about is balloons. All you talk about is balloons. Your beautiful house is full of bits and pieces of balloons. Your books are all about balloons, every time you sing a song, it is in some way obliquely connected with balloons... Everything you eat has to have "balloon" incorporated in the title. Your dogs are all called Balloono. You tie balloons to your ankles in the evenings!</p>

          <h3>Column 1</h3>
          <p>Cluster ballooning is a ballooning technique where a single balloonist is attached to a cluster of helium-inflated rubber balloons by means of harness. This differs from the standard ballooning in that there is no basket or gondola (just a harness or a seat) and while there is single large balloon is equipped with vents enabling altitude control here the only way to control the altitude is to jettisons or deflate balloons or to use ballast. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h3>Column 2</h3>
          <p>Cluster balloons are also flown in the very early morning, when winds are calm and a crew of fifteen to twenty people is needed to inflate the balloons in about an hour and a half. Inflated balloons are sealed with tape and cable ties, and are tied with nylon twine which will be used to attach in groups of four or more to the ends of long nylon straps called risers. These risers are then attached to the pilot's harness which is designed for paragliding and has a rear-mounted emergency parachute - for an emergency. When enough balloons are tied to the harness, pilot gives a signal and he is released from the ground tether. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h3>Column 3</h3>
          <p>Wind carries the cluster balloon and the fact that different wind directions exist at different altitudes can be used to steer the balloon. Toy balloon is used prior to launch so a pilot could see the wind directions of different altitudes. Recreational flying is done on altitudes between 1,000 and 1,500m. Chase crew is needed during the landing to help the pilot and stop the balloon from dragging the pilot and potentially hurting him. If there is no crew and the winds are too strong the pilot may have to cut away the harness or burst many balloons to stop from dragging.</p>

  <h1>The Golden Age of Ballooning</h1>
  <p>On July 2, 1982, Walters attached 43 of the balloons to his lawn chair, filled them with helium, put on a parachute, and strapped himself into the chair in the backyard of a home at 1633 West 7th Street in San Pedro. He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, beer, and a camera. When his friends cut the cord that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep, Walters's lawn chair rose rapidly to a height of about 16,000 feet (4,900 m) and was spotted from two commercial airliners. He slowly drifted over Long Beach and crossed the primary approach corridor of Long Beach Airport. Instead he reached some 5,000 meters on July 2, 1982. He safely landed (although he managed to contact power lines at landing) and was fined several thousand dollars by the FAA because you need a license to fly anything.

      <p>The first to use cluster balloons was Jean Piccard, a ballooning pioneer who in 1937 tried this idea. He used using 98 latex weather balloons attached to a hot air balloon basket and achieved height of 3km. After him came others. In 1954, Gary Cashman used hydrogen-filled weather balloons attached to a seat on which he made several flights. Jean Piccard’s son Don also flew cluster balloons in 1957 and 1962. Second flight was to 5,400m which is still a world altitude record for this type of balloons. Professionals weren’t the only ones who tried this kind of flying. Smaller balloons are easier to obtain than bigger balloons, which makes them more accessible to the amateurs and untrained which we all know how can end.</p>

      <p>Yoshikazu Suzuki used helium balloons in a similar way and took off from Lake Biwa in Japan on November 23, 1992. Japanese coast guard airplane saw him on November 25th somewhere 800 km offshore over the Pacific Ocean but after that was never seen again. Roman Catholic priest Adelir Antonio de Carli used 1000 balloons in April 2008, in Brazil. He flew above the ocean and his body was later found on 5 July 2008. In June 2008, FAA licensed pilot Jonathan R. Trappe attached cluster balloons to an office chair and flew to an altitude of 4,500m. Trappe also crossed the English Channel with a cluster balloon setup on May 28, 2010.</p>
